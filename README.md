# open-wiiflow-mod
Beta Repository of the USB Loader Wiiflow

This is basically just my personal wiiflow.
nothing fancy.  basically i plan on removing quite a bit of stuff from wiiflow to make it smaller and less
cluttered.  Stuff that isn't necassary anymore or that very few people use. hopefully with less clutter then the memory
overflows and weird habbits of wiiflow will go away.

plan to remove:

dios mios (lite) support and auto mios - lets face it with nintendont and devolution these aren't needed anymore.

trailer videos - really who uses these?

fanart - sorry but yes its just not needed anymore.  yes some fanart is better than the banner but oh well.

the d-pad source selection i added a long time ago.

Wii grab and wiimote roll - again very few if any people even know about these.

and more.

And I plan on making minor settings menu changes. 
Im even considering making big changes to the source menu like making more like the plugin select menu.
How much free time i get will tell how much i really do change.
